# Automated-LIcense-Plate-Recognization
Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR), also known as Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), is a technology that uses optical character recognition (OCR) on images to read vehicle registration plates. It's widely used for law enforcement, toll collection, access control, and traffic monitoring.


How ALPR Works

1. Image Capture: Cameras (often infrared) capture images of vehicles.


2. Plate Detection: The system locates the license plate region within the image.


3. Character Segmentation: Characters on the plate are isolated.


4. Optical Character Recognition (OCR): The characters are read and converted into digital text.


5. Data Matching & Storage: The license plate number can be checked against databases for stolen vehicles, expired registrations, etc.
