# Automated-LIcense-Plate-Recognization
Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR), also known as Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), is a technology that uses optical character recognition (OCR) on images to read vehicle registration plates. It's widely used for law enforcement, toll collection, access control, and traffic monitoring.

Applications

Law Enforcement: Detect stolen vehicles, track suspects.

Toll Collection: Charge vehicles automatically without stopping.

Parking Management: Grant access or charge fees based on plate numbers.

Border Control: Track cross-border vehicle movement.

Traffic Monitoring: Analyze traffic patterns and congestion.


How ALPR Works

1. Image Capture: Cameras (often infrared) capture images of vehicles.


2. Plate Detection: The system locates the license plate region within the image.


3. Character Segmentation: Characters on the plate are isolated.


4. Optical Character Recognition (OCR): The characters are read and converted into digital text.


5. Data Matching & Storage: The license plate number can be checked against databases for stolen vehicles, expired registrations, etc.
